# PlanarDeltaProject
Yo, I am new to this whole Github thing, so proceed with that in mind.

This is the home of the Planar Delta Printer Project (PDPP). All official files, updates, and documentation for the project will be found here.

All "demo" files represent are of a mockup I made in an hour just to prove the concept. Files not labeled "demo" represent real, working designs.
